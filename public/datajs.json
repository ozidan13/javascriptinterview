  "question": "What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript",
  "answer": "There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:\n\n   1. **Object literal syntax:**\n\n      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = {\n           name: \"Sudheer\",\n           age: 34\n      };\n      ```\n\n      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.\n\n      **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object.\n\n   2. **Object constructor:**\n\n      The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = new Object();\n      ```\n\n      The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so \"new\" keyword is not required. The above code snippet can be re-written as:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = Object();\n      ```\n\n   3. **Object's create method:**\n\n      The `create` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects.\n      The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.\n\n      The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = Object.create(null);\n      ```\n      The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let vehicle = {\n        wheels: '4',\n        fuelType: 'Gasoline',\n        color: 'Green'\n      }\n      let carProps = {\n        type: {\n          value: 'Volkswagen'\n        },\n        model: {\n          value: 'Golf'\n        }\n      }\n\n      var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);\n      console.log(car);\n      ```\n\n   4. **Function constructor:**\n\n      In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function Person(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = 21;\n      }\n      var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n      ```\n\n   5. **Function constructor with prototype:**\n\n      This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function Person() {}\n      Person.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\n      var object = new Person();\n      ```\n\n      This is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function func() {}\n\n      new func(x, y, z);\n      ```\n\n      **(OR)**\n\n      ```javascript\n      // Create a new instance using function prototype.\n      var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)\n\n      // Call the function\n      var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),\n\n      // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\n      console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n      ```\n   6. **Object's assign method:**\n\n      The `Object.assign` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object.\n\n      The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const orgObject = { company: 'XYZ Corp'};\n      const carObject = { name: 'Toyota'};\n      const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);\n      ```\n\n   7. **ES6 Class syntax:**\n\n      ES6 introduces class feature to create objects.\n\n      ```javascript\n      class Person {\n        constructor(name) {\n          this.name = name;\n        }\n      }\n\n      var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n      ```\n\n   8. **Singleton pattern:**\n\n      A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = new (function () {\n        this.name = \"Sudheer\";\n      })();\n      ```"

  "question": "What is a prototype chain",
  "answer": "**Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. i.e, When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, the created object inherits properties from a prototype object.\n\n   The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or **\\_\\_proto\\_\\_** property whereas prototype on constructor function is available through **Object.prototype**.\n\n   ![Screenshot](images/prototype_chain.png)"

  "question": "What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind",
  "answer": "The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,\n\n   **Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one\n\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n\n   invite.call(employee1, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   invite.call(employee2, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n\n   **Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array\n\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n\n   invite.apply(employee1, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   invite.apply(employee2, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n\n   **Bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments\n\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n\n   var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);\n   var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);\n   inviteEmployee1(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   inviteEmployee2(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n\n   Call and Apply are pretty much interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.\n\n   Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind()."

  "question": "What is JSON and its common operations",
  "answer": "**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json\n\n   **Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object\n\n   ```javascript\n   JSON.parse(text);\n   ```\n\n   **Stringification:** Converting a native object to a string so that it can be transmitted across the network\n\n   ```javascript\n   JSON.stringify(object);\n   ```"

  "question": "What is the purpose of the array slice method",
  "answer": "The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end of the array. This method can also accept negative index which counts back from the end of the array.\n\n   Some of the examples of this method are,\n\n   ```javascript\n   let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]\n   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]\n   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]\n   let arrayIntegers4 = arrayIntegers.slice(-3, -1); //returns [3, 4]\n   ```\n\n   **Note:** Slice method doesn't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array."

{
  "id": 6,
  "question": "What is the purpose of the array splice method",
  "answer": "The **splice()** method adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position/index for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.\n\n   Some of the examples of this method are:\n\n   ```javascript\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]\n   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]\n   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 5]\n   ```\n\n   **Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array."

  "question": "How do you compare Object and Map",
  "answer": "**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases:\n\n   1. The keys of an Object can be Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive type.\n   2. The keys in a Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in the order of insertion.\n   3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.\n   4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.\n   5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in an object that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by creating an object(which can be called a map) using `Object.create(null)`, but this practice is seldom done.\n   6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs."

  "question": "What is the difference between == and === operators",
  "answer": "JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,\n\n   1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.\n   2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal, i.e., having the same number value.\n      There are two special cases in this,\n      1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.\n      2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.\n   3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.\n   4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.\n   5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with == .\n      i.e, `null===undefined --> false`, but `null==undefined --> true`\n\n   Some of the example which covers the above cases:\n\n   ```javascript\n   0 == false   // true\n   0 === false  // false\n   1 == \"1\"     // true\n   1 === \"1\"    // false\n   null == undefined // true\n   null === undefined // false\n   '0' == false // true\n   '0' === false // false\n   NaN == NaN or NaN === NaN // false\n   []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory\n   {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory\n   ```"

  "question": "What are lambda expressions or arrow functions",
  "answer": "An arrow function is a shorter/concise syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.\n\n    Some of the examples of arrow functions are listed as below,\n    ```javascript\n    const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b; // Multiple parameters\n    const arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10; // Single parameter\n    const arrowFunc3 = () => {} // no parameters\n    ```"

  "question": "What is a first class function",
  "answer": "In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.\n\n    For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener\n\n    ```javascript\n    const handler = () => console.log(\"This is a click handler function\");\n    document.addEventListener(\"click\", handler);\n    ```"

{
  "id": 13,
  "question": "What is a higher order function",
  "answer": "A higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.\n    The syntactic structure of higher order function will be as follows,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const firstOrderFunc = () =>\n      console.log(\"Hello, I am a First order function\");\n    const higherOrder = (ReturnFirstOrderFunc) => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();\n    higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);\n    ```\n    You can also call the function which you are passing to higher order function as callback function.\n\n    The higher order function is helpful to write the modular and reusable code."

  "question": "What is the currying function",
  "answer": "Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. By applying currying, an n-ary function turns into a unary function.\n\n    Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n    console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6\n\n    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;\n    curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c\n    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c\n    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6\n    ```\n\n    Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** and **functional composition**."

{
  "id": 16,
  "question": "What is a pure function",
  "answer": "A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.\n\n    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,\n\n    ```javascript\n    //Impure\n    let numberArray = [];\n    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);\n    //Pure\n    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>\n      argNumberArray.concat([number]);\n\n    //Display the results\n    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    ```\n\n    As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value, whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.\n\n    Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with the **Immutability** concept of ES6: giving preference to **const** over **let** usage."

  "question": "What is the purpose of the let keyword",
  "answer": "The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the `var` keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.\n\n    Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,\n\n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 30;\n    if (counter === 30) {\n      let counter = 31;\n      console.log(counter); // 31\n    }\n    console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)\n    ```"

  "question": "What is memoization",
  "answer": "Memoization is a functional programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.\n    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const memoizeAddition = () => {\n      let cache = {};\n      return (value) => {\n        if (value in cache) {\n          console.log(\"Fetching from cache\");\n          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.\n        } else {\n          console.log(\"Calculating result\");\n          let result = value + 20;\n          cache[value] = result;\n          return result;\n        }\n      };\n    };\n    // returned function from memoizeAddition\n    const addition = memoizeAddition();\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached\n    ```"

  "question": "What is Hoisting",
  "answer": "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.\n    Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(message); //output : undefined\n    var message = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";\n    ```\n\n    The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,\n\n    ```javascript\n    var message;\n    console.log(message);\n    message = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";\n    ```\n\n    In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too\n\n    ```javascript\n    message(\"Good morning\"); //Good morning\n\n    function message(name) {\n      console.log(name);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared."

  "question": "What are classes in ES6",
  "answer": "In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.\n    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Bike(model, color) {\n      this.model = model;\n      this.color = color;\n    }\n\n    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {\n      return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n    };\n    ```\n\n    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative\n\n    ```javascript\n    class Bike {\n      constructor(color, model) {\n        this.color = color;\n        this.model = model;\n      }\n\n      getDetails() {\n        return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n      }\n    }\n    ```"

  "question": "What are closures",
  "answer": "A closure is the combination of a function bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables, functions and other data even after the outer function has finished its execution. The closure has three scope chains.\n\n    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets\n    2. Outer function's variables\n    3. Global variables\n\n    Let's take an example of closure concept,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Welcome(name) {\n      var greetingInfo = function (message) {\n        console.log(message + \" \" + name);\n      };\n      return greetingInfo;\n    }\n    var myFunction = Welcome(\"John\");\n    myFunction(\"Welcome \"); //Output: Welcome John\n    myFunction(\"Hello Mr.\"); //output: Hello Mr. John\n    ```\n\n    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned."

},
{
  "id": 33,
  "question": "How do you reuse information across service worker restarts",
  "answer": "The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts."

Terminate a Web Worker:\n       Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use the terminate() method to terminate listening to the messages.\n\n    ```javascript\n    w.terminate();\n    ```\n\n    4.

  "question": "Why do we need callbacks",
  "answer": "The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response, javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.\n    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.\n\n    ```javascript\n    function firstFunction() {\n      // Simulate a code delay\n      setTimeout(function () {\n        console.log(\"First function called\");\n      }, 1000);\n    }\n    function secondFunction() {\n      console.log(\"Second function called\");\n    }\n    firstFunction();\n    secondFunction();\n\n    // Output:\n    // Second function called\n    // First function called\n    ```\n\n    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed.

This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `\"use strict\";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode. This also enables block-scoped variables."
},
{
  "id": 67,
  "question": "Why do you need strict mode",
  "answer": "Strict mode is useful to write \"secure\" JavaScript by notifying \"bad syntax\" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object."
},
{
  "id": 68,
  "question": "How do you declare strict mode",
  "answer": "The strict mode is declared by adding \"use strict\"; to the beginning of a script or a function.\n    If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.\n\n    ```javascript\n    \"use strict\";\n    x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared\n    ```\n\n    and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope\n\n    ```javascript\n    x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.\n    myFunction();\n\n    function myFunction() {\n      \"use strict\";\n      y = 3.14; // This will cause an error\n    }\n    ```"

  "question": "What is the purpose of double exclamation",
  "answer": "The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, it will be true.\n    For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    let isIE8 = false;\n    isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);\n    console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false\n    ```\n\n    If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator."

  "question": "How do you check whether a string contains a substring",
  "answer": "There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,\n\n     1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring\n\n     ```javascript\n     var mainString = \"hello\",\n       subString = \"hell\";\n     mainString.includes(subString);\n     ```\n\n     2. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var mainString = \"hello\",\n       subString = \"hell\";\n     mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;\n     ```\n\n     3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions\n\n     ```javascript\n     var mainString = \"hello\",\n       regex = /hell/;\n     regex.test(mainString);\n     ```"

  "question": "How do you check if a key exists in an object",
  "answer": "You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,\n\n     1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not\n\n        ```javascript\n        \"key\" in obj;\n        ```\n\n        and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,\n\n        ```javascript\n        !(\"key\" in obj);\n        ```\n\n     2. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)\n\n        ```javascript\n        obj.hasOwnProperty(\"key\"); // true\n        ```\n\n     3. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const user = {\n          name: \"John\",\n        };\n\n        console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true\n        console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false\n        ```"

  "question": "What is tree shaking",
  "answer": "Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`."
},
{
  "id": 152,
  "question": "What is the need of tree shaking",
  "answer": "Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers."

  "question": "What are the string methods that accept Regular expression",
  "answer": "There are six string methods: search(), replace(), replaceAll(), match(), matchAll(), and split().\n\n     The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"Hello John\";\n     var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6\n     ```\n\n     The replace() and replaceAll() methods are used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"ball bat\";\n     var n1 = msg.replace(/b/i, \"c\"); // call bat\n     var n2 = msg.replaceAll(/b/i, \"c\"); // call cat\n     ```\n\n     The match() and matchAll() methods are used to return the matches when matching a string against a regular expression.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"Hello John\";\n     var n1 = msg.match(/[A-Z]/g); // [\"H\", \"J\"]\n     var n2 = msg.matchAll(/[A-Z]/g); // this returns an iterator\n     ```\n\n     The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"Hello John\";\n     var n = msg.split(/\\s/); // [\"Hello\", \"John\"]\n     ```"

[abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)\n        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets\n        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |\n     2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning.\n        For example, below are some use cases,\n        1. \\\\d: Used to find a digit\n        2. \\\\s: Used to find a whitespace character\n        3. \\\\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word\n     3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities.\n        For example, below are some use cases,\n        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n\n        2. n\\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n\n        3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n"

  "question": "How does synchronous iteration works",
  "answer": "Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,\n\n     **Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.\n\n     **Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.\n\n     **IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property determines whether the element is the last element or not.\n\n     Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const iterable = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"];\n     const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }\n     ```"

  "question": "What is an event loop",
  "answer": "The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.\n\n     **Note:** The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background."
},
{
  "id": 237,
  "question": "What is call stack",
  "answer": "Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,\n\n     1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.\n     2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.\n\n     Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format\n\n     ```javascript\n     function hungry() {\n       eatFruits();\n     }\n     function eatFruits() {\n       return \"I'm eating fruits\";\n     }\n\n     // Invoke the `hungry` function\n     hungry();\n     ```\n\n     The above code processed in a call stack as below,\n\n     3. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n     4. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n     5. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.\n     6. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.\n\n     ![Screenshot](images/call-stack.png)"

  "question": "What is an event queue",
  "answer": "The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.\n\n     Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of the promise is moved into the microtask queue).\n\n     The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue."

Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.\n\n        ```javascript\n        (function () {\n          function fun1() {\n            console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n          }\n          fun1();\n        })();\n\n        (function () {\n          function fun1() {\n            console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n          }\n          fun1();\n        })();\n        ```\n\n     3. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.\n\n        ```javascript\n        {\n          let myFunction = function fun1() {\n            console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n          };\n          myFunction();\n        }\n        //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n\n        {\n          let myFunction = function fun1() {\n            console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n          };\n          myFunction();\n        }\n        //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n        ```"

  "question": "Why do you need to avoid with statement",
  "answer": "JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.\n\n     ```javascript\n     a.b.c.greeting = \"welcome\";\n     a.b.c.age = 32;\n     ```\n\n     Using `with` it turns this into:\n\n     ```javascript\n     with (a.b.c) {\n       greeting = \"welcome\";\n       age = 32;\n     }\n     ```\n\n     But this `with` statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument."

Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the second loop is `4 4 4 4`.\n\n     Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is `0 1 2 3`."

If you do, it throws below error\n\n     ```bash\n     Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared\n     ```\n\n     **Explanation:** The variable declaration with `var` keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var name = \"John\";\n     function myFunc() {\n       var name = \"Nick\";\n       var name = \"Abraham\"; // Re-assigned in the same function block\n       alert(name); // Abraham\n     }\n     myFunc();\n     alert(name); // John\n     ```\n\n     The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,\n\n     ```javascript\n     let name = \"John\";\n     function myFunc() {\n       let name = \"Nick\";\n       let name = \"Abraham\"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n       alert(name);\n     }\n\n     myFunc();\n     alert(name);\n     ```"

  "question": "What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard",
  "answer": "The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “\\*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n     ```javascript\n     targetWindow.postMessage(message, \"*\");\n     ```"

{
  "id": 327,
  "question": "How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers",
  "answer": "Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute. \n     \n     For example, let's check the sender's origin [http://www.some-sender.com](http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side [www.some-receiver.com](www.some-receiver.com),\n\n     ```javascript\n     //Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/\n     window.addEventListener(\"message\", function(message){\n         if(/^http://www\\.some-sender\\.com$/.test(message.origin)){\n              console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);\n        }\n     });\n     ```"

  "question": "Can I avoid using postMessages completely",
  "answer": "You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge."

  "question": "What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy",
  "answer": "There are two ways to copy an object,\n\n     **Shallow Copy:**\n     Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.\n\n     **Example**\n\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetails = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 25,\n       expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n     };\n     ```\n\n     to create a duplicate\n\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!\n     ```\n\n     if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:\n\n     ```javascript\n     empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";\n     ```\n\n     The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.\n\n     **Deep copy:**\n     A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\n\n     **Example**\n\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetails = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 25,\n       expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n     };\n     ```\n\n     Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable\n\n     ```javascript\n     var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n       name: empDetails.name,\n       age: empDetails.age,\n       expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n     };\n     ```\n\n     Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`"

  "question": "Does javascript uses mixins",
  "answer": "Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one `[[prototype]]` for an object.\n\n     But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.\n\n     Say for instance, we've two classes `User` and `CleanRoom`. Suppose we need to add `CleanRoom` functionality to `User`, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.\n\n     ```javascript\n     // mixin\n     let cleanRoomMixin = {\n       cleanRoom() {\n         alert(`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now`);\n       },\n       sayBye() {\n         alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);\n       },\n     };\n\n     // usage:\n     class User {\n       constructor(name) {\n         this.name = name;\n       }\n     }\n\n     // copy the methods\n     Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);\n\n     // now User can clean the room\n     new User(\"Dude\").cleanRoom(); // Hello Dude, your room is clean now!\n     ```"

Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object).

  "question": "How to cancel a fetch request",
  "answer": "Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.\n     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,\n\n     1. Create an `AbortController` instance\n     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal\n     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal\n        For example, passing the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const controller = new AbortController();\n     const { signal } = controller;\n\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n\n     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests\n     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);\n     ```"

It has two main parts:\n\n     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.\n        The example below shows how to use this API to get text from speech,\n\n     ```javascript\n     window.SpeechRecognition =\n       window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF\n     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();\n     recognition.onresult = (event) => {\n       // SpeechRecognitionEvent type\n       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;\n       console.log(speechToText);\n     };\n     recognition.start();\n     ```\n\n     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone\n\n     2. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.\n        For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,\n\n     ```javascript\n     if (\"speechSynthesis\" in window) {\n       var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(\"Hello World!\");\n       speech.lang = \"en-US\";\n       window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);\n     }\n     ```\n\n     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.\n     **Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)"

  "question": "What is minimum timeout throttling",
  "answer": "Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.\n     **Browsers:** They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.\n     Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.\n     **Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.\n     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```\n\n     and the output would be in\n\n     ```cmd\n     Script loaded\n     My script is initialized\n     ```\n\n     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be sequential.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     runMeFirst();\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```\n\n     and the output is,\n\n     ```cmd\n     My script is initialized\n     Script loaded\n     ```"

The Node.js Event Loop\n\n\n  - Browser Event Loop: The Browser Event Loop is used in client-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the browser environment, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, etc.), HTTP requests, and other asynchronous actions.\n\n  - The Node.js Event Loop is used in server-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the Node.js runtime environment, such as file I/O, network I/O, and other asynchronous actions."

  "question": "What is the purpose of queueMicrotask",
  "answer": "The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.\n\n     Example:\n\n     ```javascript\n     console.log(\"Start\"); //1\n\n     queueMicrotask(() => {\n       console.log(\"Inside microtask\"); // 3\n     });\n\n     console.log(\"End\"); //2\n     ```\n\n     By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks."

For example, let's imagine you have a library called `customLibrary` that doesn’t have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called `customLibrary` in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     declare var customLibrary;\n     ```\n\n     In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the `customLibrary` variable as `any` type.

For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).\n     Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.\n     In a simple sentence, a polyfill is a shim for a browser API."

  "question": "How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type",
  "answer": "In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,\n\n     ```javascript\n     var myPrimitive = 30;\n     var myNonPrimitive = {};\n     function isPrimitive(val) {\n       return Object(val) !== val;\n     }\n\n     isPrimitive(myPrimitive);\n     isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);\n     ```\n\n     If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object."

  "answer": "The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.\n\n     Let's see this difference with an example,\n\n     **Function Constructor:**\n\n     ```javascript\n     var a = 100;\n     function createFunction() {\n       var a = 200;\n       return new Function(\"return a;\");\n     }\n     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100\n     ```\n\n     **Function declaration:**\n\n     ```javascript\n     var a = 100;\n     function createFunction() {\n       var a = 200;\n       return function func() {\n         return a;\n       };\n     }\n     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200\n     ```"

  "question": "How do you prevent promises swallowing errors",
  "answer": "While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.\n\n     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,\n\n     ```javascript\n     Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").then(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n\n     Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n\n     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n     ```\n\n     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,\n\n     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\")\n          .then(function () {\n            throw new Error(\"error\");\n          })\n          .catch(function (error) {\n            console.error(error.stack);\n          });\n        ```\n\n        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.\n\n     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").done(function () {\n          throw new Error(\"error\");\n        });\n        ```\n\n        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp()\n          .then(function (result) {\n            return processDataAsync(result);\n          })\n          .done(function (processed) {\n            displayData(processed);\n          });\n        ```\n\n        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {\n          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));\n        });\n        ```\n\n        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.\n\n     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**\n        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {\n          throw error;\n        });\n        ```\n\n        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {});\n        ```"

  "question": "What is a Proper Tail Call",
  "answer": "First, we should know about tail call before talking about \"Proper Tail Call\". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.\n\n     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`\n\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return 1;\n       }\n       return n * factorial(n - 1);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```\n\n     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return acc;\n       }\n       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```\n\n     The above pattern returns the same output as the first one.

  "question": "What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?",
  "answer": "It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. This can be contrasted with the logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand if the left operand is any falsy value, not only null or undefined.\n\n     ```js\n     console.log(null ?? true); // true\n     console.log(false ?? true); // false\n     console.log(undefined ?? true); // true\n     ```"

  "question": "How do you group and nest console output?",
  "answer": "The `console.group()` can be used to group related log messages to be able to easily read the logs and use console.groupEnd()to close the group. Along with this, you can also nest groups which allows to output message in hierarchical manner.\n\n     For example, if you’re logging a user’s details:\n\n     ```js\n     console.group(\"User Details\");\n     console.log(\"name: Sudheer Jonna\");\n     console.log(\"job: Software Developer\");\n\n     // Nested Group\n     console.group(\"Address\");\n     console.log(\"Street: Commonwealth\");\n     console.log(\"City: Los Angeles\");\n     console.log(\"State: California\");\n\n     // Close nested group\n     console.groupEnd();\n\n     // Close outer group\n     console.groupEnd();\n     ```\n\n     You can also use `console.groupCollapsed()` instead of `console.group()` if you want the groups to be collapsed by default."

  "question": "How do you reverse an array without modifying original array?",
  "answer": "The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n     const newArray = originalArray.reverse();\n\n     console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n     console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n     ```\n\n     There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.\n\n     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [value, ...accumulator];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [...accumulator, value];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          accumulator.push(value);\n          return accumulator;\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```"

  "answer": "Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles and API calls_. This in turn enhance the web page performance. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.\n\n     Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using `clearTimeout` and reschedule API call/DB query for a new time—300 ms in the future.\n\n     ```js\n     function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {\n       let timer;\n       return function (...args)  {\n         clearTimeout(timer);\n         timer = setTimeout(() => {\n           func.apply(this, args);\n         }, timeout);\n       };\n     }\n     function fetchResults() {\n       console.log(\"Fetching input suggestions\");\n     }\n     const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());\n     ```\n\n   The _debounce()_ function can be used on input, button and window events.\n\n  **Input:**\n\n  ```html\n  <input type=\"text\" onkeyup=\"processChange()\" />\n  ```\n\n  **Button:**\n\n  ```html\n  <button onclick=\"processChange()\">Click me</button>\n  ```\n\n  **Windows event:**\n\n  ```html\n  window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", processChange);\n  ```"

  "answer": "It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,\n\n     1. Array.isArray() method:\n\n        The `Array.isArray(value)` utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        Array.isArray(numbers); // true\n        Array.isArray(user); //false\n        ```\n\n     2. instanceof operator:\n\n        The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is an Array other false for other type.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        console.log(numbers instanceof Array); // true\n        console.log(user instanceof Array); // false\n        ```\n\n     3.

Since there is a new space created for variable `b`, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable `a`.\n\n     Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.\n\n     ```javascript\n     let user1 = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 27,\n     };\n     let user2 = user1;\n     user2.age = 30;\n\n     console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30\n     ```\n\n     In the above code snippet, updating the `age` property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference."

  "answer": "* The `this` keyword in JavaScript is a special variable that is used within a function to refer to the object on which the function is invoked. The value of this depends on how the function is called. It allows functions to access and interact with the object they are bound to.\n* The this keyword in JavaScript is a reference to the object that owns or invokes the current function. Its value is determined by the calling context.\n\n  **Example 1: this in a Global Context**\n  ```javascript\n  console.log(this);\n  ```\n  * In a global context, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).\n\n  **Example 2: this in a Function**\n  ```javascript\n  function displayThis() {\n    console.log(this);\n  }\n\n  displayThis();\n  ```\n  *  In a regular function, this refers to the global object.\n\n  **Example 3: this in a Method**\n  ```javascript\n  const person = {\n    name: 'John',\n    greet: function() {\n      console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);\n    }\n  };\n\n  person.greet();\n  ```\n  * In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method (person in the case).\n\n  **Example 4: this in an Event Handler**\n  ```javascript\n  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {\n    console.log(this);\n  });\n  ```\n  *  In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case)."

  "question": "What are the uses of closures?",
  "answer": "Closures are a powerful feature in programming languages like JavaScript. They allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This means that a function defined within another function can access variables from the outer function, even if the outer function has already returned.\nHere are some common use cases of closures:\n\n*  Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods. By defining variables within a function's scope and returning inner functions that have access to those variables, you can create     a form of encapsulation, limiting access to certain data or functionality.\n\n*  Function Factories: Closures are often used to create functions with pre-set parameters. This is useful when you need to create multiple functions with similar behavior but different configurations.\n\n*  Callback Functions: Closures are frequently used in asynchronous programming, such as handling event listeners or AJAX requests. The inner function captures variables from the outer scope and can access        them when the callback is invoked.\n\n*  Memoization: Closures can be used for memoization, a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls. The inner function can remember the results of previous calls and      return the cached result if the same input is provided again.\n\n*  iterators and Generators: Closures can be used to create iterators and generators, which are essential for working with collections of data in modern JavaScript."

  "answer": "The execution context in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the information necessary for executing a piece of code. It includes the code itself, the values of the variables used in the code, and the scope chain. The scope chain is a list of objects that are used to resolve variable names.\n\nThe execution context has two phases:\n* Creation phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. This includes creating the variable object and the scope chain.\n* Execution phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. This includes evaluating expressions, assigning values to variables, and calling functions.\n\nThe execution context is created when a function is called. The function's code is then executed in the execution context. When the function returns, the execution context is destroyed."

  "answer": "   The polyfills for array methods such as map, filter and reduce methods can be created using array prototype. \n\n 1. **map:**\n     \n    The built-in `Array.map` method syntax will be helpful to write polyfill. The map method takes the callback function as an argument and that callback function can have below three arguments passed into it.\n\n      i. Current value\n      ii. Index of current value(optional)\n      iii. array(optional)\n\n    The syntax would like below,\n\n    ```js\n    let newArray = arr.map(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {\n       // return new array after executing the code\n    })\n    ```\n\n    Let's build our map polyfill based on the above syntax, \n\n    ```js\n      Array.prototype.myMap = function(cb) {\n        let newArr = [];\n        for(let i=0; i< this.length; i++) {\n          newArr.push(cb(this[i], i, this));\n        }\n        return newArr;\n      };\n\n      const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n      const multiplyByTwo = nums.myMap(x => x * 2);\n      console.log(multiplyByTwo); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n    ```\n    In the above code, custom method name 'myMap' has been used to avoid conflicts with built-in method.\n\n  2. **filter:** \n      Similar to map method, `Array.filter` method takes callback function as an argument and the callback function can have three agurguments passed into it.\n\n          i. Current value\n          ii. Index of current value(optional)\n          iii. array(optional)\n\n      The syntax looks like below,\n\n      ```js\n      let newArray = arr.filter(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {\n        // return new array whose elements satisfy the callback conditions\n      })\n      ```\n      Let's build our filter polyfill based on the above syntax, \n\n      ```js\n      Array.prototype.myFilter = function(cb) {\n        let newArr = [];\n        for(let i=0; i< this.length; i++) {\n           if(cb(this[i], i, this)) {\n             newArr.push(this[i]);\n           }\n        }\n        return newArr;\n      }\n\n      const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n      const evenNums = nums.myFilter(x => x % 2);\n      console.log(evenNums); // [2, 4, 6]\n      ```\n 3. **reduce:**\n\n      The built-in `Array.reduce` method syntax will be helpful to write our own polyfill. The reduce method takes the callback function as first argument and the initial value as second argument.\n\n      The callback function can have four arguments passed into it.\n      i. Accumulator\n      ii. Current value\n      iii.

  "question": "What is the difference between map and forEach functions?",
  "answer": "     Both map and forEach functions are used to iterate over an arrays but there are some differences in their functionality.\n\n     1. **Returning values:** The `map` method returns a new array with transformed elements whereas `forEach` method returns `undefined` eventhough both of them are doing the same job.\n\n      ```javascript\n        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        arr.map(x => x * x); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n        arr.forEach(x => x * x); // \n        \n        The `forEach()` method in JavaScript always returns undefined. This is because forEach() is used to iterate over arrays and perform side effects on each element, rather than returning a `new array or transforming the original array`\n      ```\n\n     2. **Chaining methods:** The `map` method is chainable. i.e, It can be attached with `reduce`, `filter`, `sort` and other methods as well. Whereas `forEach` cannot be attached with any other methods because it returns `undefined` value.\n\n      ```javascript\n        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        arr.map(x => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); // 55\n        arr.forEach(x => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur);; //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefine(reading 'reduce')\n      ```\n     3. **Mutation:** The `map` method doesn't mutate the original array by returning new array. Whereas `forEach` method also doesn't mutate the original array but it's callback is allowed to mutate the original array.\n\n     **Note:** Both these methods existed since ES5 onwards."

  "question": "What are hidden classes?",
  "answer": "Since JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, you can add or remove properties and methods from objects on the fly at runtime. This nature of JavaScript increases the dynamic dictionary lookups(because objects implemented as HashTables in memory) for retrieving a property on an object. \n\n     Let's consider the following example to see how the additional properties `age` and `gender` added at runtime.\n\n     ```javascript\n      function Person(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n      }\n\n      var person1 = new Person('John');\n      var person2 = new Person('Randy');\n\n      person1.age = 40;\n      person1.gender = \"Male\";\n\n      person2.gender = \"Female\";\n      person2.age = 50;\n     ```\n    \n     As a result, this behavior leads to lower JavaScript performance compared to the contiguous buffer method used in non-dynamic languages. The V8 engine provided a solution named **hidden classes** to optimize the access time when retrieving a property on an object. This optimization is achieved by sharing hidden classes among objects created in a similar fashion. These hidden classes are attached to each and every object to track its shape.\n    \n     When V8 engine sees the constructor function(e.g, Person) is declared, it creates a hidden class (let's say Class01) without any offsets. Once the first property assignment statement (`this.name = name`) is executed, V8 engine will create a new hidden class (let's say Class02), inheriting all properties from the previous hidden class (Class01), and assign the property to offset 0. This process enables compiler to skip dictionary lookup when you try to retrieve the same property(i.e, name). Instead, V8 will directly point to Class02. The same procedure happens when you add new properties to the object. \n     \n     For example, adding `age` and `gender` properties to `Person` constructor leads to transition of hidden classes(Class02 -> Class03 -> Class04). If you create a second object(Person2) based on the same Person object, both Class01 and Class02 hidden classes are going to be shared. However, the hidden classes Class03 and Class04 cannot be shared because second object has been modified with a different order of properties assignment. \n     \n     Since both the objects(person1 and person2) do not share the hidden classes, now V8 engine cannot use **Inline Caching** technique for the faster access of properties.

  "id": 462,
  "question": "What is inline caching?",
  "answer": "  Inline caching is an optimization technique based on the observation that repeated calls to same function tends to occur on same type of objects. The V8 compiler stores a cache of the type of objects that were passed as a parameter in recent method calls. Upon next time when same function is called, compiler can directly search for the type in cache.\n\n  Let's consider an example where the compiler stores the shape type in cache for repeated calls in the loop.\n\n  ```js\n    let shape = {width : 30,  height: 20}; // Compiler store the type in cache as { width: <int>, height: <int>} after repeated calls\n    \n    function area(obj) {\n      //Calculate area\n    }\n    for(let i=0; i<100; i++) {\n      area(shape);\n    }\n  ```\n  After few successful calls of the same area method to its same hidden class, V8 engine omits the hidden class lookup and simply adds the offset of the property to the object pointer itself. As a result, it increases the execution speed.\n\n  There are mainly 3 types of inline caching possible:\n\n  1. Monomorphic: This is a optimized caching technique in which there can be always same type of objects passed.\n  2. Polymorphic: This ia slightly optimized  caching technique in which limited number of different types of objects can be passed.\n  3. Megamorphic: It is an unoptimized caching in which any number of different objects can be passed."

Non-mutating methods: These methods return a new array without altering the original one.\n\n   There are 9 methods in total that mutate the arrays,\n   1. **push:** Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.\n   2. **pop:**  Removes the last element from the array and returns that element.\n   3. **unshift:**  Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length..\n   4. **shift:** Removes the first element from the array and returns that element.\n   5. **splice:** Adds or removes elements from the array at a specific index position.\n   6. **sort:** Sorts the elements of the array in-place based on a given sorting criteria.\n   7. **reverse:** Reverses the order of elements in the given array.\n   8. **fill:**  Fills all elements of the array with a specific value.\n   9. **copyWithIn:** Copies a sequence of elements within the array to a specified target index in the same array."

  "question": "What is module scope in JavaScript?",
  "answer": "  Module scope is a feature introduced with ES6 (ES2015) modules that creates a scope specific to a module file, isolating variables and functions declared within it from the global scope and other modules. Variables and functions declared in a module are private by default and can only be accessed by other modules if they are explicitly exported.\n\n   Key characteristics of module scope:\n\n   1. Variables declared in a module are scoped to that module only.\n   2. Each module has its own top-level scope\n   3. Variables and functions need to be explicitly exported to be used in other modules\n   4. The global scope cannot access module variables unless they are explicitly exported and imported\n   5. Modules are always executed in strict mode\n   \n  ```javascript\n  // moduleA.js\n\n  // This variable is PRIVATE to moduleA. It's like a tool inside a closed box.\n  const privateVariable = \"I am private\";\n\n  // This variable is PUBLIC because it's exported. Others can use it when they import moduleA.\n  export const publicVariable = \"I am public\";\n\n  // PUBLIC function because it's exported. But it can still access privateVariable inside moduleA.\n  export function publicFunction() {\n      console.log(privateVariable); // ✅ This works because we're inside the same module.\n      return \"Hello from publicFunction!\";\n  }\n\n  // moduleB.js\n\n  // Importing PUBLIC items from moduleA.\n  import { publicVariable, publicFunction } from './moduleA.js';\n\n  console.log(publicVariable);       // ✅ \"I am public\" - Works because it's exported.\n  console.log(publicFunction());     // ✅ \"Hello from publicFunction!\" - Works as well.\n\n  // ❌ This will cause an ERROR because privateVariable was NOT exported from moduleA.\n  // console.log(privateVariable);   // ❌ ReferenceError: privateVariable is not defined\n\n  ```\n  Common use cases and benefits:\n\n  - Encapsulation of module-specific code\n  - Prevention of global scope pollution\n  - Better code organization and maintenance\n  - Explicit dependency management\n  - Protection of private implementation details"
